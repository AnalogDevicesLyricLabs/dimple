Dimple is an open-source software tool for probabilistic modeling, inference, 
and learning.  Dimple allows models to be specified in the form of a factor
graph, which is a type of probabilistic 
graphical model, and can perform inference on those models using a variety of 
algorithms, including various forms of belief propagation and Gibbs sampling.
