Dimple version 0.08 release notes
==================================

Significant Changes Since v0.07

* Categorical and DiscreteTransition factor functions no longer limited to zero-based integers and can be used with arbitrary discrete variables.

* SolverOptions.maxAutomaticFactorTableSize option allows control of when factor tables are generated based on size.

* New events for monitoring Gibbs solver.

* New scheduler & scheduleValidator options in BPOptions and GibbsOptions for specifying schedulers and
  schedule validation logic.

    - Apache commons math 3.2 -> 3.5
    - JTransforms 2.3 -> 3.0
