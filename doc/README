Dimple Documentation
==================

About
-----
The Dimple Documentation is written in an asciidoc format.  This allows for 
efficient integration with source control, relative ease of use for writers, 
excellent latex integration and the ability to generate both pdf and html 
documents.  The downside is that people contributing to the documentation 
must install asciidoc and dblatex in order to test that their modifications 
to the documentation will build.

Requirements
------------
* dblatex - dblatex allows writers to embed latex within asciidoc documentaiton.
* LaTeX - LaTeX provides an easy way to embed mathematical equations within 
  	  documentation.
* AsciiDoc - AsciiDoc converts files in AsciiDoc format into various formats 
  	     including HTML and pdf.


Ubuntu
~~~~~~

-----------------------------
sudo apt-get install asciidoc
sudo apt-get install dvipng
sudo apt-get install dblatex
-----------------------------

Be sure to open a new terminal after doing all of this.

Mac OS X
~~~~~~~~

To install all of these components you can use macports:

-------------------------
sudo port install dvi2png
sudo port install asciidoc
sudo port install dblatex
-------------------------

WARNING: Macports is a bit dangerous since it installs a lot of dependencies.  
This can result in your machine containing parallel installations of various 
packages.  

Building the Documentation
--------------------------

.Cleaning out the documentation

The following command removes the output directory as well as the pdfs.

----
python builddoc.py -c
----

.Building the user documentation as a pdf

----
python builddoc.py -u -p
----

.Building the user documentation as HTML

----
python builddoc.py -u -x
----

.Building the user documentation with nicer formatting

----
python builddoc.py -u -n
----

.Building Developer Documentation as pdf

----
python builddoc.py -d -p
----

The developer documentation takes the same flags as the user documentation

.Multiple commands

----
python builddoc.py -c -d -u -n -x -p
----

This will first run a clean and then build the user and developer doc as both 
nice HTML and pdf

Generated Files
---------------
All documentation files are generated in the "output" directory.  The pdfs 
(if they are created) are copied to the same directory that contains this 
README.
