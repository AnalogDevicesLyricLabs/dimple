Dimple Documentation
==================

Building the documentation
--------------------------

The Dimple Documentation is written in LaTeX.  In order to build the documentation, developers must have LaTeX installed.

To build the user documentation:

----
python builddoc.py -u
----

The previous command will produce both Java and MATLAB documentation.  If you want just one or the other use:

----
python builddoc.py -j
----

for java documentation and:

----
python builddoc.py -m
----

for MATLAB documentation.

To build the developer documentation:

----
python builddoc.py -d
----

Editing the User Documentation
------------------------------
The Java and MATLAB documentation are built from the same source.  As a result, all MATLAB specific content should be contained with:

\ifmatlab
matlab specific stuff
\fi

and all Java specific content should be contained with:

\ifjava
java specific stuff
\fi

When editing the Latex with TexShop, you can modify a flag in the DimpleUserManual.tex 
file to switch between java and MATLAB documentation.  Find the following text:

\ifdefined\forjava
	\javatrue
\else
	\ifdefined\formatlab
		\matlabtrue
	\else		
                %modify this flag to matlabtrue or javatrue when editing with TexShop
                %When building from the commandline this will be ignored.
		\javatrue
	\fi
\fi

Modify the last \javatrue to \matlab true or vice versa.
