<h1>Dimple proxy applet test page</h1>

This page simply embeds a dimple proxy applet that may be tested manually
using the JavaScript interpreter in your web browser.
<p>
Unless the applet Jars have been properly signed (and they probably won't be) you
will need to answer a dialog to allow the applet to run, and you may either have
to lower the security level in the Java Control Panel or add the site to the 
"Exception Site List" to allow lowered security for applets loaded from the
specified sites.
